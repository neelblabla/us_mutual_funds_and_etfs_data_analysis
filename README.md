# us_mutual_funds_and_etfs_data_analysis

### Objective 

I study and analyze a public dataset on US Exchange Traded Funds and Mutual Funds. 

I set up personal objective to answer the following questions through this exercise: 
* How has the popularity of funds progressed over the years – overall and certain cohort based?
* How has the financial performance of funds progressed over the years – overall and certain cohort based?
* How are different fund performance indicators correlated, if at all?
* What ETF and MF category should I invest in, if I favor a particular performance metric over others? 

### Dataset 

4 datasets available on US Funds dataset from Yahoo Finance (kaggle.com) were collectively analyzed.
